**User**

Let's describe and edit the idea of the project.

This project is using Aspire dotnet to orchestrate all components in one bucket.

Idea of the project:
- No limits in technology stack (best from all)
- integrability and combining different technologies
- AI ready - agents. MCP server
- Distributed architecture. Dapr runtime across services. May be Dapr workflow / actors.

UltimateApp.AppHost
Aspire host - glue all together with dotnet aspire (review doc)

UltimateApp.WebApp - Front-end react app with Vite that is AI chat-bot assitent (should use assistant-ui react component with agentic integration) (review doc)

UltimateApp.ApiService - Some business API with both web API and MCP server that handle use-cases

UltimateApp.Pythob - for all AI stuff, agents, server for chat  UltimateApp.WebApp 

Describe with deep understanding and relying on the knowledge base and documentation (docs-mcp-server)

Realize all benefits and all potential about this setup.

Create architecture diagram.
